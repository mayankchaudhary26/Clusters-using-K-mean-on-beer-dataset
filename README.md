# Clusters-using-K-mean-on-beer-dataset
Company X would like to enter the market with a new beer brand. Before it decides the kind of beer it will launch, it must understand what kinds of products already exist in the market and what kinds of segments the products address. To understand the segments, the company collects specifications of few samples of beer brands (as given in the Beer Dataset).  Assuming there are 3 segments, use K-Means Algorithm to create three clusters using the Beer Dataset. Once the clusters are finalized, interpret the clusters for company X.
